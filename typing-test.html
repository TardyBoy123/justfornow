                    In a world where technology evolves at an unprecedented pace, the ethics of artificial intelligence pose significant dilemmas.
                    Consider a self-driving car programmed to minimize harm. Faced with an unavoidable accident, should it prioritize the lives
                    of its passengers over pedestrians? This moral quandary challenges utilitarian principles, questioning whether the greater
                    good is truly served by sacrificing one for many. Furthermore, as AI becomes more autonomous, we must confront issues of
                    accountability. When an algorithm makes a decision that results in harm, who bears responsibilityâ€”the programmer, the user,
                    or the machine itself? Such ethical dilemmas require humanity to balance innovation with compassion, ensuring that technological
                    advancements remain anchored in the core values of justice and empathy. Hence, thoughtful discourse is crucial in guiding
                    ethical frameworks that govern AI development, safeguarding human dignity in the digital age.
